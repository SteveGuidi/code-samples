# Atari 2600 BASIC Keyboard Interfacing Project
Documents, sample programs, and firmware for interacing a modern keyboard with an Atari 2600.  Firmware is stored in the `KeyboardController` folder, and requires the [PS2KeyAdvanced](https://git.io/JZcGj) library instaled beforehand.

Code samples and microcontroller pin mappings are stored in the `Reference Docs and Programs` folder.
